### Research Focus Area: Strategies for using questioning and discussion techniques to deepen student understanding

#### Abstract:
Student questioning is an important learning strategy, but rare in many classrooms, because teachers have concerns if these questions contribute to attaining curricular objectives. Teachers face the challenge of making student questioning effective for learning the curriculum. To address this challenge, a principle-based scenario for guiding effective student questioning was developed and tested for its relevance and practicality in two previous studies. In the scenario, which consists of a sequence of pedagogical activities, mind maps support teachers and students to explore and elaborate upon a core curriculum, by raising, investigating, and exchanging student questions. In this paper, a follow-up study is presented that tested the effectiveness of the scenario on student outcomes in terms of attainment of curricular objectives. Ten teachers and their 231 students participated in the study. Pre- and posttest mind maps were used to measure individual and collective learning outcomes of student questioning. Findings show that a majority of students progressed in learning the core curriculum and elaborated upon it. The findings suggest that visualizing knowledge construction in a shared mind map supports students to learn a core curriculum and to refine their knowledge structures.


#### Research Question(s):
To what degree do mind maps support students in attaining curricular objectives? Are students able to learn a core curriculum, elaborate on it, and refine the conceptual structure of their knowledge?


#### Methods:
Statistical Analysis


#### Setting:
Quantitative analysis of design-based research project. Design-based research aims to develop a practical solution for a practitioners’ problem, as well as theoretical understandings about the effectiveness of the design principles. To measure student learning outcomes, both individual student mind maps and classroom mind maps were collected. In additional, multiple choice knowledge tests were developed in close collaboration with the participating teachers of each school; they were administered as pre and posttests.  Total participants used for analysis: 231 students (117 boys and 114 girls)  All students came from two primary schools from a suburban area in The Netherlands, and were between 8 and 12 years old. Students were evenly distributed over grades: 30.2% in grade 4, 37.1% in grade 5, and 32.8% in grade 6. The percentage of special care students was below the national average of 9% in each class.   


#### Key Findings:
• When comparing pre- and posttest mind maps, o Students were able to add more details, examples, and associations to the core curriculum o a significant higher level of knowledge organization in the mind maps was found. This could be interpreted as a development from novice to expert knowledge about the topic  Not all students progressed, however. Approximately 20% regressed remained in a status quo o outcomes showed an increase in similarity and decrease of elaboration on head branch level of student mind maps, which indicates students tended to adhere more to the conceptual structure of the core curriculum as represented in the expert mind map o a moderate increase in student performance on the knowledge test is another indicator that individual student knowledge was advanced by the mind mapping technique • students who were engaged in answering questions were more likely to learn the curriculum • It seems beneficial for students’ individual learning outcomes to discuss and visualize the construction of collective knowledge, especially when teachers relate students’ answers to the core concepts of the topic under study • all teachers were able to use mind mapping as a collective platform for linking student questions to the core curriculum o but not all teachers were aware, able, or willing to visualize the development of collective knowledge o exchanging and discussing questions and answers contributes to building collective knowledge • in each case where the classroom mind map was expanded, a large number of new concepts were added to the conceptual structure of a core curriculum. This shows that classroom mind maps can be useful platforms to exchange and visualize new knowledge. • Student Sincerely Information Seeking (SIS) questions aided the development of the expanded classroom mind maps but had no significant effects on development of individual student mind maps. These findings suggest that inquiring into a single personal question will not be sufficient for students to learn the curriculum • expanding the classroom mind map with core and elaborated concepts supported students in learning the core curriculum and refining their knowledge structures.  • The researchers concluded that visualizing collective knowledge supports individual learning outcomes. • The researchers also concluded that guiding effective student questioning by a mind map-supported scenario enhanced learning outcome of most students o Additional scaffolding seems necessary for those students for whom mind mapping exceeds their cognitive load • A key theoretical contribution of this study is that visualizing core concepts (or Big Ideas) in a mind map supports teachers to share intellectual control with their students 


#### Implications:
• Teachers should: o focus on involving all students in questioning rather than putting much effort in the formulation of the right type of questions o not only encourage students to collectively raise questions, but also make sure that all students are engaged in answering those questions o not only discuss answers with students. but also visualize for students the relations of these answers to the core curriculum o have time, practice, and support in learning to identify the key concepts of the core curriculum o be aware that some students might need additional support to internalize the collective knowledge construction • Findings of this study contribute to the development of the mind map research methodology. o While mind mapping was originally intended to support teachers in guiding effective student questioning, this study also developed a mind map research methodology that can be used to evaluate individual and collective learning outcomes. 


#### Limitations:
• The researchers did not have a randomly selected sample but a homogeneous group of students, who all had some previous experience with the scenario. • Participating classes were taught by motivated teachers who had contributed to the development of the scenario. Therefore, comparison to non-experienced teachers or classrooms could be made. • 17% of the data was incomplete because of student absence during pre- or posttest. Data from these students could not be used for analysis. • Limitations of mind mapping as a research strategy: although mind mapping seemed suitable for the target group as a visual tool, it still seemed to exceed the cognitive load of some students. This may have limited the validity of some of the findings.
