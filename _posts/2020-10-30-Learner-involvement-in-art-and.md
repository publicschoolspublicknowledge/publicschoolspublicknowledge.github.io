#### Abstract:
Art in Botswana primary schools is taught under the umbrella term Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA), a subject that encompasses various arts disciplines. The arts disciplines are Physical Education, Music, Design and Technology, Home Economics, and Drama and Dance. The subject introduces learners to various disciplinary knowledge, media, and techniques in the arts. This study focused on the visual arts as a component of CAPA. It investigated the extent to which primary school teachers involved learners in the assessment processes. The qualitative study involved 12 randomly selected primary school teachers from four purposively selected schools and four administrators purposively selected by virtue of their senior positions in practical subjects. The methodology was premised on Parlett and Hamilton's (1972) concept of illuminative evaluation, Black, Harrison, Lee, Marshall, and William's (2004) and Lindstrom's (2007) learner participation models, as well as Feldman's (1994) art criticism model. Data revealed that pupils did not meaningfully participate in the assessment of their own work due to teachers' limited knowledge of appropriate assessment procedures. Teachers did not share the assessment criteria, which were limited to numerical grades and comments such as good, fair, and excellent. Pupils were not involved in critical analysis and evaluation of their art and craft works while in progress. Teachers emphasized the end product and marking was done without any prior negotiation of grading criteria with learners. The study recommends a shared approach to assessment, which values both the process and product of artistic engagement by the learner. Teacher education programs are encouraged to seriously consider assessment of the arts, particularly self assessment as it is this critical dimension that measures children's artistic growth and development.


#### Research Question(s):
To what extent do primary school teachers involve learners in the assessment processes of their own artistic engagements? What approaches, procedures, and assessment criteria do teachers use to evaluate pupils in art and design? How effective are such strategies in assessing the fundamental aspects of art and design and addressing the practical requirements suggested in the CAPA syllabus? To what extent are teachers knowledgeable and skilled to assess pupils for their artistic growth in art and design? How do administrators and teachers view assessment in art and design education?


#### Methods:
Literature Review, qualitative study


#### Setting:
12 randomly selected primary school teachers from four purposively selected schools and four administrators, study conducted in South-Central and Central-North regions of Botswana


#### Key Findings:
• Data revealed that pupils did not meaningfully participate in the assessment of their own work due to teachers' limited knowledge of appropriate assessment procedures. Pupils were not involved in critical analysis and evaluation of their art and craft works while in progress.  • Teachers did not share the assessment criteria, which were limited to numerical grades and comments such as good, fair, and excellent. Instead, teachers emphasized the end product and marking was done without any prior negotiation of grading criteria with learners.  • The observations indicate that assessment was not effectively addressed in all four sample case study classes in a direct way. • Most teachers mentioned during the interview that they did not assess practical work because they lacked knowledge and skills in the area, and could not get any assistance from their administrators who also lacked skills in the subject. • Interviews revealed there was no set standard agreed upon by teachers and administrators on how the assessment could be done. One of the responses given that revealed that teachers did not assess art and design at all as it was not regarded as a basic subject makes one wonder whether the school administrators really monitored the subject 


#### Implications:
• The study recommends a shared approach to assessment, which values both the process and product of artistic engagement by the learner. Teacher education programs are encouraged to seriously consider assessment of the arts, particularly self assessment as it is this critical dimension that measures children's artistic growth and development. • at the policy level, during teacher preparation, student teachers need to be fully grounded in formative and summative assessment of art in addition to the ability for self-assessment by learners • Teachers could also benefit if workshops on art and design assessment could be organized to assist them. • administrators should support teachers in the Botswana ministry of education requirement for teachers to keep students’ profiles. When teachers keep and write these profiles, they are expected to provide an in-depth assessment of the pupil so that one could get to know the child well enough to cater for their individual needs. 


#### Limitations:
Limited sample size, data collected from only four schools
