### Research Focus Area: Asset-based best practices for serving Black and Latinx teens

#### Abstract:
 A study examined what can be learned about black teachers and their teaching of black students to benefit all teachers. The three participating researchers all stressed the importance of having black teachers in the teaching profession and of refocusing how teachers are educated; highlighted roadblocks and barriers and the importance of role models; and stressed the importance of teachers' ability to establish relationships with their students, believing that teachers from various backgrounds can develop these relationships to benefit black students.


#### Research Question(s):
What positive traits do Black teachers teaching Black students possess that can benefit teachers from all ethnic backgrounds in instructing Black students?


#### Methods:
Interview


#### Setting:
This study involves interviewing three retired Black teachers on their perspectives regarding instruction of minority students in America.


#### Key Findings:
• Black teachers often feel isolated and unheard in both urban and rural contexts, as preparation programs and school culture are often tailored for white female teachers. • Black teachers are authentic, act as positive role models, see potential in their Black students and consider them capable of success. • Black teachers are highly effective because they empathize with the unique situations and needs of their black students, understanding the reasons behind behaviors while maintaining high expectations. • Black teachers motivate their students to excel through shared cultural connections that make their teaching meaningful, relevant and responsive to Black students’ lives. 


#### Implications:
To improve outcomes for Black students, all teachers can: • Adopt culturally responsive approaches and a structured classroom management style with high expectations for Black students.  •  Build culturally informed connections and respectful parent relationships. 


#### Limitations:
The three experts interviewed had conducted research on the topic of instructing Black students, but also offered personal experience and opinion. Thus, some claims and ideas may need to be verified through direct research and intervention in the classroom.
