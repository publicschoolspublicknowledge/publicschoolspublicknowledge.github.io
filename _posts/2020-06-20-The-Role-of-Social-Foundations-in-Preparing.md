### Research Focus Area: Strategic planning strategies for school leaders

#### Abstract:
Addressing the issue of teachers' low expectations of students of color and those in poverty poses significant challenges to teacher education. The growing body of research focused on this issue documents ways teachers can make a real difference in the educational lives of children. Ladson-Billings' (1992; 1994; 1995) and others demonstrate that teachers can work with students to challenge socio-economic inequities, succeed academically, and retain pride in their cultural backgrounds. Based on a review of literature about preparing culturally competent teachers, this article argues that social foundations courses, especially courses in the history and sociology of education, are critical for teacher candidates to understand the power of racial, ethnic, and socio-economic inequities and the relationship of these factors to the pedagogical practices of schools and teachers in order for teachers to engage in culturally relevant practice.


#### Research Question(s):
How can culturally relevant pedagogy increase the achievement of low-income minority students? How can we prepare teachers to increase cultural relevance in their classroom?


#### Methods:
Literature Review


#### Setting:
nan


#### Key Findings:
• Children of color routinely score lower on reading proficiency exams and are overrepresented in special education. • Cultural knowledge does not automatically translate into culturally relevant teaching; effective teachers of minorities are keenly aware of cultural identities and social class. • High expectations for success, home support and understanding obstacles unique to race are critical to improving outcomes for children of color. 


#### Implications:
Teacher preparation programs can improve outcomes for minority children by integrating social foundation courses that raise awareness of historical inequalities in education and the educational experiences of minorities.


#### Limitations:
This literature review draws on a body of research regarding minority achievement in the 1990s; thus, more recent statistics are needed to verify claims as trends may have changed.
