### Research Focus Area: English Language Learners: instructional strategies, assessments, developing academic language

#### Abstract:
The population of English Language Learners (ELLs) in the United States, in the K-12 context, is diverse and comprised of lesser-known subordinate groups including Long-term English Language Learners (LTELLs). The LTELL designation refers to students who, after attending schools for six or more years, still require English as a New Language (ENL) support services (Olsen, 2010b). These students are known to have stalled academic proficiency, and remain in protracted ELL status, unable to master the content necessary to pass the state mandated benchmark English language proficiency tests. There is a small but growing body of literature that addresses LTELL students’ academic and social characteristics (e.g. Menken & Kleyn, 2010; Olsen, 2010b). The current review seeks to add to the extant body of knowledge onLTELLs by classifying, synthesizing and evaluating previous scholarship on this population. This review is undergirded by the following research questions: (RQ1) What are the proficiency factors of LTELLs? To what extent do these proficiency factors affect language and literacy development? (RQ2) What are the instructional factors and intervention practices which affect LTELLs? To what extent do these instructional factors impact LTELLs literacy and language development? (RQ3) What are the affective factors which affect performance for LTELLs? To what extent do these affective factors impact LTELLs literacy and language development?


#### Research Question(s):
What is the proficiency level of Long-term English Language Learners, or LTELLs, and how does this level of proficiency impact language development? Are there any instructional factors or interventions that affect this group? Are there any other factors affecting LTELL literacy and language performance?


#### Methods:
Literature Review


#### Setting:
nan


#### Key Findings:
• Proficiency characteristics can range from an inaccurate self-perception to difficulties interacting with the academic context. • Instructional factors include placement of LTELLs, such as when an older LTELL might be placed in a classroom with younger ELLs.  • Additional factors include how the student perceives themselves, as well as factors like confidence and personal motivation. 


#### Implications:
Instruction for LTELLs should be informed by the following principles: • The proficiency level of LTELLs are influenced by a variety of factors, ranging from poor instruction to feelings of low self-esteem. Instructional factors need to consider all of these aspects when providing instruction, including both curricular and environmental considerations. •  Many LTELLs will benefit from encouragement as a means to boost motivation and enhance self-esteem. 


#### Limitations:
The literature review is extensive, but a natural limitation is that the study only focuses on prior literature with no collection of primary data on the success of these instructional models in classroom settings. An intervention approach could provide better evaluation to realize the effectiveness of the suggested interventions and approaches.
