#### Abstract:
As secondary school leaders consider a shift toward standards-based grading (SBG) practices, they are no doubt weighing the odds of a successful implementation process. This research followed up on a study from 2014 to identify the challenges secondary school leaders experience when changing the currency of the classroom from points to learning. The results indicated that the game is changing and a new wave of SBG implementation is on the horizon. 


#### Research Question(s):
To what extent are secondary school principals considering a shift to SBG? What are the current perceived barriers to the implementation of SBG? How do the current perceived barriers compare with the barriers found in the first wave of implementation?


#### Methods:
Literature Review, Survey


#### Setting:
100 participants of secondary school principals in Iowa


#### Key Findings:
• A Second Wave of SBG Implementation Is Coming o A strong majority of participants indicated the shifting the grading practices was a part of their vision within the next 5 years. The researchers concluded that, although school leaders know SBG implementation to be a huge challenge, a second wave of SBG implementation is indeed on the horizon in Iowa. They also concluded that this work will have to be done in a slow, methodical manner. • Barriers to SBG Implementation o The barrier most commonly identified by survey participants was teacher resistance. Many principals seemed to indicate that teachers who have been in the profession for a while are likely to be resistant to this shift in grading philosophy, favoring “traditional” or “old-school” grading methods instead. Many comments also identified a general “fear of change” among teachers. o Several comments indicated time as a barrier to SBG implementation, stating that high school principals would need time to bring about changes slowly and educate the community on the efficacy of SBG. o The final key barrier identified is a need for more professional development. Participants responded with concerns about proper training, misinformation, and understanding the teaching philosophy behind SBG. • Barriers of the First Wave Compared With the Anticipated Second Wave o The researchers found that the barriers to SBG implementation have changed since the first wave, particularly due to technology advancements in student information systems. In the first wave, a salient concern was that electronic gradebook programs used  points and percentages to calculate and report grades, a practice counter to SBG. It seems these systems have advanced and met the demands of the market, so this barrier does not prevail into the anticipated second wave. o A theme of “the tradition of grading and fear of the unknown” emerged as a barrier to implementation in the first wave, and surfaces again, albeit to a lesser extent, in the second wave of implementation. 


#### Implications:
• School leaders should implement SBG slowly, taking heed of the magnitude of professional development required to ensure teacher cooperation in SBG implementation. They must create meaningful opportunities for teachers to both ask critical questions and respond to practice-clarifying questions. They should also seek input from teachers regarding potential topics and delivery methods of professional development. Teachers should have the opportunity to evaluate professional development, and leaders should use this feedback to guide further professional development. • Utilizing a network rather than hierarchical approach, principals will need to influence key teachers who will lead their colleagues toward a shared understanding of effective grading axioms.  • University admission officials, intermediate educational service agencies, and state department officials should familiarize themselves with the principles of SBG. • University admission officials should consider establishing ongoing focus groups with principals, counselors, and other key personnel in order to better understand the benefits and drawbacks of SBG communication on the transcript. 


#### Limitations:
• Participants were limited to high school principals in one state. • District superintendents, curriculum directors, and other central office decision makers were not included in this study. • The open-ended question regarding barriers, although qualitative in nature, did not allow for follow-up questions or clarification.
