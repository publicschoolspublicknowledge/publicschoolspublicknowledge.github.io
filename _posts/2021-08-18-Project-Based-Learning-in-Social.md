#### Abstract:
Project-Based Learning (PBL) is increasingly popular in K-12 schools, not just in the United States but around the world. It’s not going to be one of those education fads that comes and goes; we at the Buck Institute for Education believe it will become a permanent feature of 21stcentury education. Why? For several reasons.


#### Research Question(s):
Why is project-based learning useful for social studies?


#### Methods:
Literature Review


#### Setting:
-


#### Key Findings:
• Project-based learning (PBL) is useful because • PBL is useful for all students, not just those who are advanced or fluent in English • PBL in social studies can be found in all grade levels and courses • Some projects are single-subject, and some are multi-disciplinary, taught by a team of teachers of art, English, science, career/tech, or math • Projects can be done individually, or in teams o The authors recommend team projects, so long as they are well managed and grades are not based mainly on group projects • It’s easier to find authenticity for a project about recent history, where students can interview people who lived through it or can find evidence of its lasting impact on their community.  • A project on more distant history is often more engaging if it can be connected to themes or issues that students would find relevant to today • Some “classic” PBL social studies projects include o A debate, speech, social media campaign, or multimedia presentation on a current event or controversial issue—the more local and personally relevant to students, the better. o A museum exhibit about a historical time, place, person, event, or development. o A proposal for a monument that explains a historical event or development. o A simulation of a situation when people in the past, or in the present day, have to solve a problem, make a decision, or advise a leader. o Signage, a podcast, a guided tour, a field guide, or an annotated online map about local history. o An action or service learning project to benefit the community • The default “Powerpoint Presentation” assignment can be fraught with problems, as it tends to be met with tedious presentations with boatloads of information copied from a website, but no critical thinking or creativity o Slide presentations should be adopted with caution. They might be appropriate if they have an authentic purpose, such as persuading the city council to adopt a new policy. 


#### Implications:
The Buck Institute for Education developed a model for “Gold Standard PBL” to help ensure PBL’s effectiveness and longevity. Student learning goals are always kept in focus, and the project should have the following seven Essential Project Design Elements: • A challenging problem or question • Sustained inquiry • Authenticity o It is appropriate for history teachers to use simulations occasionally, instead of demanding that all projects be fully “real-world” • Student Voice and Choice • Reflection • Critique and Revision • Public Product o Not all projects have to have every one of the Essential Elements emphasized—as long as they’re present to some extent.
