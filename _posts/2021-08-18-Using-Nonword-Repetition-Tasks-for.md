#### Abstract:
The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to evaluate the clinical utility of a verbal working memory measure, specifically, a nonword repetition task, with a sample of Spanish-English bilingual children and (b) to determine the extent to which individual differences in relative language skills and language use had an effect on the clinical differentiation of these children by the measures. A total of 144 Latino children (95 children with typical language development and 49 children with language impairment) were tested using nonword lists developed for each language. The results show that the clinical accuracy of nonword repetition tasks varies depending on the language(s) tested. Test performance appeared related to individual differences in language use and exposure. The findings do not support a monolingual approach to the assessment of bilingual children with nonword repetition tasks, even if children appear fluent speakers in the language of testing. Nonword repetition may assist in the screening of Latino children if used bilingually and in combination with other clinical measures.


#### Research Question(s):
Can nonword repetition tasks be a more effective method for assessing language impairment in young bi-lingual learners? 


#### Methods:
Literature Review, Statistical Analysis, Controlled Study


#### Setting:
school classrooms in Southern California


#### Key Findings:
-Many traditional methods of screening for language impairment in American schools are based on monolingual English-speaking students. -This study used a task of repeating Spanish- and English-sounding nonwords in order to more accurately screen bilingual students for language impairment.  -The study drew its conclusions from a total of 95 typical language development students and 49 students with language impairment from Spanish-English speaking backgrounds. The students were an average age of 6 years old.  -Using a list of specifically selected syllables to resemble English and Spanish words, the researchers asked students to repeat back nonsensical syllables.  -The results of the study showed that students with typical language developed scored significantly higher for both the English and Spanish repetition task, which demonstrates that a non-word repetition task can help screen bilingual learners. .  -Students with language impairments are expected to do worse in both languages. 


#### Implications:
Due to the statistical analysis using a positive likelihood ratio, the researchers were able to find that a score of 70% or lower in both SNWRT and ENWRT was more than nine times likely to come from a child with language impairment. The study demonstrated that some language impaired children were able to pass the test in one language or the other (but not both) which once again emphasizes the higher risk of misclassification if bilingual students are only screened in one language. Early screening of children using the nonword repetition task in English and Spanish may help identify Latino students more at risk for language impairment and prevent academic delays.  


#### Limitations:
However, neither the English or Spanish non-word repetition task can accurately rule out the presence of language impairment, because students with typical language development may have varying skills in one language compared to the other. Due to the variations in language skill and vocabulary across the board of both students with typical language development and those with language impairments, the nonword repetition task should only be used as a screening measure alongside other clinical assessments in order to accurately place bilingual students.
