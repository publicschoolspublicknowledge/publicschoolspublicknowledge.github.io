### Research Focus Area: Opportunities for students to create authentic work for real audiences beyond the teacher

#### Abstract:
As part of a School-Community Partnership Grant sponsored by the Texas Center for Service Learning, students in the Sweet Home Independent School District, a rural district in south central Texas, are engaging in thoughtfully organized meaningful service experiences. This article shares strategies that the service learning leadership team used during the first year to build partnerships, develop lessons integrated into students' academic curriculum, and form a student leadership team focused on identifying actual community needs.


#### Research Question(s):
 What strategies can help students make adequate yearly progress according to state and federal accountability standards and at the same time build respect, responsibility and leadership?


#### Methods:
Intervention


#### Setting:
 A pre k-8 school district in rural Texas. It is a middle-to-low socioeconomic community. 


#### Key Findings:
• Within the Teen Leadership class, the teacher and students develop a network of support, learn to be assertive, set goals, and carefully consider their choices and opportunities.  • One strategy that was put into place immediately was meeting and greeting students at the door each day to let them know that they are valued. • Developing mutually beneficial partnerships with businesses and community organizations allows students to build positive relationships with community members while participating in service-learning projects. • Service learning is distinct from service learning. Community service involves helping others in the community in some determined areas of need. On the other hand, service learning involves service projects that are mutually beneficial and all participants in the project gain from the experience. • In service learning, students learn the knowledge and skills taught in their grade level appropriate curriculum while performing a service for their community that is based upon a need that is determined by all participants. 


#### Implications:
School districts should adopt service learning because it • allows students to learn in a meaningful way that has a higher purpose. • builds support for public schools among the general public • engages students in civic activities that they may continue throughout their lives. • welcomes the larger community into the schools that they financially support • gives students and teachers a chance to give back to the local community that supports them • has the potential to change the public perception of schools squandering public dollars on meaningless curriculum • fosters a sense of service and stewardship in students • Students who participate in service learning should be recognized and celebrated by the community at the culmination of the school year or service learning project. 


#### Limitations:
• Participants were self-selected • This article supports its claims with qualitative data only. • This article tracks only one iteration of a service learning program
