### Research Focus Area: English Language Learners: instructional strategies, assessments, developing academic language

#### Abstract:
This review examines current research on teaching English Language Learners (ELLs) in four content area subjects: History, math, English, and science. The following topics are examined in each content area: The linguistic, cognitive, and sociocultural features of academic literacy and how this literacy can be taught; general investigations of teaching; and professional development or teacher education issues. The article summarizes key findings in the literature, examining trends and discontinuities across the different content areas, and concludes with implications for teaching and suggestions for further research.


#### Research Question(s):
What key strategies exist in the literature for effectively delivering content to English Language Learners?


#### Methods:
Literature Review


#### Setting:
American, canadian, and australian schools post-1990


#### Key Findings:
• A rapidly increasing presence of English-Language-Learners (ELLs) in American schools are at high risk for academic failure HISTORY Linguistic Issues: • The language of history textbooks can be very difficult for ELLs in particular. The authors recommend that social studies teachers explicitly teach their students the grammatical features of history language to develop learner proficiency in reading and writing. • Systemic-functional linguists view content as being construed and understood through language; language instruction is therefore not a separate or additional strand in the classroom, it is content instruction. Sociocultural Issues: • The information and skills needed for students to be successful went beyond linguistic and history knowledge to include factors like familiarity with popular culture, confidence, and the ability to participate in “quick-paced, highly intertextual interactions”. • ELLs are often very quiet in class discussions and express fear of being ridiculed by native English speakers, who see them as a silent, undifferentiated mass, ignoring their different backgrounds and personalities. Pedagogical Issues: • Several authors in the literature review recommend projects that connect to the students’ home languages and cultures. Suggestions for such projects include the use of photographs, children’s literature, texts written at lower grade levels, graphic organizers, and group work. • Another author emphasizes the use of technology (word processing or other software programs) and the use of storytelling and personal narrative to engage students with course content. • There exists a misguided belief that math is less difficult for ELLs because it is based on a language of numbers. Language is a critical issue in math teaching since most of the content is conveyed through oral language. • One study concludes that ELLs can acquire mathematical skills in a constructivist environment and can succeed to the same degree as their English-speaking counterparts. 


#### Implications:
HISTORY • In the context of history, students can be taught to identify different types of verbs while reading textbook passages. • The author suggests that more attention be paid to students’ social-psychological needs by teachers, and that teachers work to broaden the perspectives of ELLs’ English-speaking classmates. • The author recommends teaching techniques designed to foster active processing of content, including the use of guiding questions and brainstorming. MATH • Bilingual teachers need to fully understand the linguistic characteristics of classroom language and also must have mastery of techniques that will assist students in connecting everyday language with the language of math. • Word problems can be derived from students’ personal narratives, thus enabling students to grasp “mathematized” language. • In one study, successful teachers were careful observers of the students and were able to identify their needs and backgrounds without relying on stereotypes. Second, they didn’t require their students to speak in English at all times, thus demonstrating that they valued their students’ first language and culture. This was the case even when the teachers themselves didn’t understand Spanish.  • Successful teachers teachers ask students to work in cooperative groups, in that way giving the learners opportunities for exploring ideas through discussion. • The authors that teachers must have a critical perspective on culture, seeing both the positive aspects as well as ones that may not promote academic success, for example, attitudes about gender roles. ENGLISH • The author highlights the value of dual-entry journals in which students comment on a particular section of text • The author stresses the importance of arousing student interest before they begin a reading assignment.  • Other themes found in the literature review include the use of graphic organizers to assist student understanding of vocabulary and story organization.  • Other articles point to topics such as the teaching of cognitive strategies or presenting material through multiple modalities, that is, both in oral and written forms. SCIENCE • An inquiry-based approach to science teaching is widely advocated for in the field. • Authors found evidence of increasing academic success over time in which instruction was offered bilingually (in English and Spanish) • The authors note that teachers require extensive support in changing their practices and that the change takes a great deal of time. • Teachers must be aware of instructional approaches that can effectively engage all students in “doing” science rather than simply memorizing facts • Science teachers must to take on roles other than that of the expert and to initiate classroom activities that are student centered and exploratory.
