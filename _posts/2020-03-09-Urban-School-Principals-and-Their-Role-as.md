### Research Focus Area: Strategic planning strategies for school leaders

#### Abstract:
This  study  focuses  on  the  role  of  urban  school  principals  as  multicultural leaders. Using cross-case analysis, the authors describe what 6 practicing principals  do  in  regard  to  multicultural  leadership.  The  findings  suggest  that although  multicultural  preparation  was  lacking  for  these  principals, some  did engage  in  work  that  promoted  diversity  in  their  daily  activities.  All  principals dealt  with  multicultural  issues, usually  focusing  on  individual  students  or  specific programs to accommodate immigrants or refugees. Although some principals  held  high  expectations  for  all,  others  were  less  aware  of  the  connection between  affirming  diversity  and  student  achievement.  Recommendations  are made to support principals in their work.


#### Research Question(s):
How did principals in an urban public school district address "the multicultural issues facing their schools"?


#### Methods:
Ethnography


#### Setting:
4 elementary schools and 2 high schools in an urban public school district


#### Key Findings:
Principals felt that they had little preparation to become multicultural school leaders. "All  6  principals  had  roles  as  multicultural  leaders  in  dealing with  diversity  issues  in  their  respective  schools.  All  principals were  generally  empathetic  with  new  immigrants,  attempting  to demonstrate  cultural  sensitivity  and  appreciating  the  cultural diversity brought to the school by students from as near as Mexico and as far away as Afghanistan. But although some administrators held  high  expectations  for  all  youngsters,  others  maintained deficit views about certain groups of students" (577).


#### Implications:
Evaluation  of  teachers (and  principals)  could  include  multicultural  proficiency  as  a dimension of evaluation. In predominantly White schools, there is a  need  for  school  administrators  to  be  attentive to issues of racism, intolerance, and prejudice (579). "As  issues  of  equity, excellence, and  social  justice  are addressed in the schools, principals are more likely to be successful if they receive consistent reinforcement and support from their district-level  administrators... Finally, to  integrate  multicultural  leadership  principles  within oneâ€™s  practice,  school  principals  can  be  encouraged  to  be  self-reflective and to critique their own school sites and context" (580).


#### Limitations:
Limited sample size, all six principals in the study were identified as Caucasian.
