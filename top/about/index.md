## Public Schools | Public Knowledge

Classroom teachers and school leaders are often urged to implement “research-based” efforts, but peer-reviewed academic research is often inaccessible. The day-to-day expectations of teachers take precedence over the ability to find, read, and implement research in their classrooms. And even when teachers do have access to academic research, they do not always find it engaging or relevant. Public Schools|Public Knowledge is a tool for addressing this issue.

PSPK is a free online database offering research summaries: short synopses of findings from peer-reviewed research relevant to public school teachers and their practice, curated and organized according to their stated interests and areas of need. As shorthand, we call it “Wikipedia for education research.”

If you’re a teacher, we hope that this tool can strengthen your knowledge and practice as you work hard to serve your students. And if you’re a researcher, we hope you will see PSPK as a way to get your crucial findings out to the public school educators and community members that can use them.
